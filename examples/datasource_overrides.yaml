# Demonstrate how to modify the data read from a data source.
#
# Data can be overridden in two ways:
#
#   1. for the entire datasource
#   2. on a station basis
#
# The following fields can be changed for entirety of a data source:
#
#   t, sx, sy, sz, w
#
# This gives the opportunity to change weighting of coordinates across
# the whole data source, as well as adjust the epoch in case it is not
# registered correctly in the original source data.
#
# Similarly, coordinate data can be adjusted at a station level. Here
# all aspects of a coordinate can be changed. The available fields are:
#
#   station, t, x, y, z, sx, sy, sz, w
#
# This is useful in case the source data has errors in it or if it would
# be helpful to weigth a particular station differently that the rest.
