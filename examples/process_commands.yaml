# Demonstrate the use of the pre- and post-processing commands.
# Any command that is available in the system PATH should be
# possible to execute through Transformo. This example mainly
# shows the syntax of this feature set but in a production
# setting it could be used to prepare data before using it as
# datasources or perhaps plotting statitics in a post-processing
# command based on the output of a Presenter.
#
# Note that output the processing commands is withheld unless
# Transformo is called with the `-v` flag that increases verbosity.
